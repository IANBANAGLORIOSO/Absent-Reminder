# Absent-Reminder
Description:
       This application is to help students or professionals to minimize their absences and to improved their attitude. Student attendance along with effective teaching , has the greatest influence on student engagement and achievement. All students must be present at school so they can participate and engage in learning. Parents and boards of trustees are legally responsible to ensure students'regular attendance at school. These guidlines aim to assist schools to manage attendance electively, and so contribute to improving student engagement and achievement, especially for students and also the professionals learners who are over represented in the statistics. So I created this application to help this people to be aware about their faults and absences.
